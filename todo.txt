## GAMELOGIC (+ FIRST JOIN) ##
- player gets to select a class,
  which provides base bonuses
  (e.g. archer -> mining fatigue but
  slightly faster walk speed)

  join any arenas, maybe implement tutorial?

## CLASS LOGIC ##
- disable armor damage (configurable)
- legacy vs custom soup:
  custom mode: configurable heal item, stacked
  amount of heal items displayed in action bar,
  refill after killstreak reached. 
  legacy mode: fill inventory with soup, refill
  with sign or killstreak (configurable)
- display arrows & stew left as action message (nms)
- special abilities per kit. 
- implement class shop (free version kit/command only)
  premium version will include physical per player
  kit shop with armor stands and kit preview mode.
  (each kit can be played twice in real arena OR 
  in a custom PvE playground)
- Classes can be upgraded using COINS or, optionally,
  any VAULT API compatible currency from 3rd party plugins.

## SKILLS LOGIC ##
- Skills are recharged per killstreak reached,
  plugin with come with easy to understand API
  to code custom skills/modify behaviour of
  existing skills. May also include custom
  "coding" language to describe skill behaviour
  in a file (FILE.skill).

  is champion, will be "marked for death", higher rewards. 
- announce kill streak every X kills
